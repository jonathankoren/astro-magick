# astro-magick
A vibe coded astronomical almanac that uses the Skyfield library.

Mainly calculates what astrological planet is in which zodiac sign, and when
it will be at its peak position in the night sky. For the moon, this transit
is calculated for full moons only.

Also can return when eclipises will occur at the location.
