# astro-magick
A vibe coded astronomical almanac that uses the Skyfield library.
Not a single line of code was written by me -- no matter how tempting it was
to just fix it myself. All code was generated by Anthropic's Claude using
Sonnet 4.6 .

This program mainly calculates what astrological planet is in which zodiac 
sign, and when it will be at its peak position in the night sky. For the 
moon, this transit is calculated for full moons only.
